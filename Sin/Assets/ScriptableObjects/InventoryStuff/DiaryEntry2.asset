  itemDescription: '"Diary, how do I make money? Mother is mad. She says that it
    is taking too long, and that I should cough up the money. She hit me very hard
    on the back, but nothing came out even though I coughed like 10000000000x!! She
    also kicked my legs but I don''t know how money can come out from them. It hurt,
    but Mother said only bad children cry."'
